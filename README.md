## I’m **Rosario Pio Gnazzo**
Hi! I'm a big fan of data, science, manga and video games.
After graduating in Statistical Sciences for Big Data I decided to continue my studies by enrolling in the master's degree in Computer Science.

I've always been fascinated by the application of mathematical and statistical formalisms to solving real-world problems: computer science should be that for me.
For this reason, I love studying theoretical computer science (such as information theory, optimization methods, etc.), but I'm currently starting to look at the field of Quantum Computing from a computer science perspective (such as quantum information theory, quantum algorithms, etc.).

### Career goals
Today, my dream is to become a **researcher** at large companies or universities, where I can study and contribute to solving significant problems that can have a concrete impact on science or people's lives. Big Techs, Universities ... I'm coming :)

### Fun fact
I discovered my passion for math and statstics thanks to a _financial mathematics course_ in high school. Since then, one of my dreams has been to work in a **Hedge Fund** – or maybe even start my own one day!
