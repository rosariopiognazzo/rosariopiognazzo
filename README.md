- 👋 Hi, I’m @rosariopiognazzo
- 👀 I'm passionate about technology, science, games, comics and generally learning new things. The world of "data" has always fascinated me, which is why I attended the degree course in Statistical Sciences for Big Data in which I graduated. Above all, I loved studying the mathematical-statistical formalisms underlying Machine Learning, which led me to choose the Data Science and Machine Learning course in Computer Science as a master's degree. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning to apply the formal notions learned during my three-year degree in different fields, from biology and finance, to network analysis and much more. In particular, I am passionate about studying network dynamics that can be used in the field of Machine Learning.
- 💞️ My dream is to become a researcher at big companies or institutions to be able to tackle problems that can have a strong impact on science or on people's lives.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I discovered my passion for statistics thanks to a financial mathematics course in high school. Since then, one of my dreams has been to work in an Hedge Fund – or who knows, maybe even start my own one day!
