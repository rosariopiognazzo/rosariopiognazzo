### ðŸ‘€ About Me

I'm passionate about **technology**, **science**, **games**, **comics**, and continuously **learning new things**. The world of **data** has always fascinated me, leading me to complete a degree in **Statistical Sciences for Big Data**. During my studies, I became especially captivated by the mathematical-statistical formalisms behind **Machine Learning**, which inspired me to pursue a **Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning**.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

I am currently focused on applying the formal knowledge from my degree across various fields, including **biology**, **physics**, **finance**, **network analysis**, and more. I'm particularly interested in studying **network dynamics** and their applications in Machine Learning.

### ðŸ’¼ Career Goals

My dream is to become a **researcher** in a large company or institution, where I can work on problems with a meaningful impact on science and society. CERN, NASA, ESA, Big Tech, Universities... I'm coming

### âš¡ Fun Fact

I discovered my passion for statistics thanks to a _financial mathematics course in high school_. Since then, one of my dreams has been to work in a **Hedge Fund** â€“ or maybe even start my own one day!
