# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Rosario Pio Gnazzo**

I'm a **Computer Science** master's student with a background in **Statistical Sciences** and a big fan of data, science, manga and video games :)
---

### ðŸ‘€ About Me

After graduating in **Statistical Sciences for Big Data** I decided to continue my studies by enrolling in the master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in **Machine Learning**.
I've always been fascinated by the world of data, especially applying mathematical-statistical formalisms on them to solve real problems - computer science must be this for me.

### ðŸŒ± What am I doing now?

Currently I'm very passionate about the study of **time series** and **graph/hypergraph theory**, to try to model and analyze problems in the most disparate disciplines: _Biology_, _Physics_, _Finance_ etc.

### ðŸ’¼ Career Goals

Today, my dream is to become a **researcher** at large companies or universities, where I can study and contribute to solving significant problems that can have a concrete impact on science or people's lives. CERN, NASA, ESA, Big Tech, Universities... I'm coming :)

### âš¡ Fun Fact

I discovered my passion for statistics thanks to a _financial mathematics course_ in high school. Since then, one of my dreams has been to work in a **Hedge Fund** â€“ or maybe even start my own one day!
